Your exercise is to write a product spec of your own. It would be awesome if you could write something that pertains to your current projects, whether personal or at work, to really utilize the domain knowledge you have. If you don't have an existing project in mind, maybe you have an idea for a site, app, or product you use frequently. If not, I have a few ready-to-go ideas for you.

- As a user of ESPN's fantasy sports app, I want to be able to click on a player's name and instantly see them playing live.
- As a user of Zoom, I want to integrate my Spotify so I can play music for everyone on the video call.
- As an open-source project maintainer on GitHub, I want to be able to assign dollar-amount bounties to issues and then actually pay someone who fulfills the issue.

Feel free to get creative on your own too!
