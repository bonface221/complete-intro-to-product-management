You are a product manager working on a direct-to-consumer e-bike company (think something like VanMoof, Cowboy, or Veloretti.) People use your bikes for commuting, exercise, joy-riding, and racing (some use it for multiple reasons, some just the one; you don't know how many are doing which, so use your judgment on which are most important). You have a user base of 500,000 users who own one of your bicycles. You have 8 engineers available to work on your projects. You are planning for the next quarter, and here are the projects that you and your team have come up with. Right now, your company is focused on all-up growth and commuters.

Here are the proposed tasks.

- Make your bikes compatible with Strava, a popular 3rd party bike tracking app. This is the #1 feature request
- Redesign the onboarding flow to help people understand their bikes better, a common customer complaint
- Add a special racing mode that tracks laps better on circular tracks
- Implement dark mode for users commuting home in the dark
- Add child mode that locks the screen until a user unlocks it to prevent kids from messing with it. This caused an accident last month, and it made the news.
- Implement caching to improve website loading speed. We are unsure how much this will affect performance
- Open source a library your team wrote for making API requests and automatically caching them
- Create an open API for users to be able to write their own integrations with their e-bikes
- Fix a weird timezone bug that only affects users in Arizona, where it will display incorrect time for one day a year
- Using retargeting information that you get from an ad vendor, show potential customers who land on your home page the exact model they looked at on Instagram

Create a prioritized roadmap for the next quarter. Add your cutline. Where information is unclear (like how many racers there are vs. commuters), use your product sense to guess or do some research on general demographics.
