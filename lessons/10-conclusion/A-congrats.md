Congrats on finishing the course!

Just to restate, you got a very biased take on how to PM from a very Microsoft, Stripe, and Snowflake perspective. I consulted other PMs to make sure I wasn't too off base, but just know there are many correct ways to do this job. Some of this advice is the opposite of what _you_ should do as you will do this job differently than me, and your company will work differently than mine. I truly did my best, and I hope it helps!

Hopefully, you enjoyed it and learned a bit about being a PM, either to improve your skills as a PM or to continue your journey to become one. I hope you enjoyed the class, and best of luck on your journey!
